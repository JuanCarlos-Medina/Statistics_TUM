# Statistics_WinterSemester19

This repository contains all the material for the Parametric Statistic course offered for master students at the Technical University of Munich.

The slides are self-contained and can be used for individual learning. The codes are helpful to implement the ideas directly with R. The literature includes amazing books that I highly recommend.
